(INSTRUCTIONS BELOW NEED TO BE UPDATED WHEN SYSTEM 
MOVES FROM BRANDINGPAYS.ORG TO BRANDINGPAYS.COM AND AGAIN
WHEN IT GOES PUBLIC)

----------------------------------------
* TODO
----------------------------------------
* Why upload dojo-1.5.0-src with every release? Couldn't that be shared by all of the releases?--> The problem with this is that I sometimes make changes to the dojo code...

----------------------------------------
* STEP A: DOJO BUILD
----------------------------------------

A.1) Do an SVN update to get the latest sources
A.2) Run the test plan to verify everything works correctly on localhost
     across all target browser scenarios
A.3) Run trunk/makeRelease.sh (see comment at top of file for instructions)

----------------------------------------
* STEP B: CREATE A ZIP FILE
----------------------------------------

B.1) Somewhere **OUTSIDE OF THE SVN TREE** (especially, not in trunk/),
     create a new folder on your local machine named bpappReleases.
     (Will already exist if you've followed these steps previously)
B.2) Within bpappReleases, create a child folder for this release
     named something like bpappYYYYMMDD (i.e., bpappReleases/bpappYYYYMMDD)
B.3) Copy the following files from trunk/ into bpappReleases/bpappYYYYMMDD
     * app
     * dojo-release-1.5.0-src
     * release
     * All PHP and HTML files (BrandingPays.php, login.php, include_session_check.php, etc.) in trunk (not in subfolders)
       (One way to make sure you get all of the PHP files is to click on the
		Kind column in the Finder so that all of the PHP files are grouped together)
B.4) Remove all of the .svn folders, *.ai and *.psd files
     * In Terminal, use "cd" command to go into the bpappReleases/bpappYYYYMMDD folder
     * Issue this command: find . -name '.svn' -exec rm -rf {} \;
       (You might error messages about no such file or directory, but shouldn't be a problem)
     * Issue this command: find . -name '*.ai' -exec rm -f {} \;
     * Issue this command: find . -name '*.psd' -exec rm -f {} \;
B.5) In Finder, go into bpappReleases
B.6) In Finder, bring up context menu (right mouse button) for
     the new folder (bpappYYYYMMDD) and issue a "Compress bpappYYYYMMDD" command
     This will create file bpappReleases/bpappYYYYMMDD.zip

----------------------------------------
* STEP C: UPLOAD THE ZIP FILE, ADD NECESSARY TXT FILES
----------------------------------------
C.1) Go into ftp tool such as FileZilla
C.2) Connect to brandingpays.org, entering username and password
C.3) In local system pane (left side?), navigate to the parent folder
     (i.e., the folder containing the bpappYYYYMMDD.zip file)
C.4) In server pane (right side?), navigate into public_html/bpappReleases
C.5) Upload the ZIP file so that the ZIP file ends up in
     server folder bpappReleases. (In Filezilla, put mouse over bpappYYYYMMDD.zip
C.6) If they do no exist already, in the public_html/users folder on the server create empty files: regcodes.txt, tools_email_list.txt, and TOU_list.txt. If admin_access.txt doesn't exist, copy it to users folder from users folder on your local machine. If it does exist, make sure it's up to date (it has the master password).
C.7) If regcodes.txt is empty, generate a random code and add it to the file, notify BrandingPays staff so they can pass it on to their clients.
----------------------------------------
* STEP D: SSH TO INMOTION
----------------------------------------
(The following can be done in the host's GUI control panel instead)
D.1) Open up a Terminal window

D.2) In Terminal, issue command "ssh -l brandi7 brandingpays.com"
     (You might get a prompt about server not recognized, say yes to prompt)
     (Password is the same as the ftp password)
	(inmotion key password: 1NR7lhpg)
     (After this step, you are logged into InMotion server)
     (If this fails, you might need to follow steps at:
	  https://support.inmotionhosting.com/cgi-bin/kb.cgi?do=read&id=60&lang=en)
D.3) On the InMotion server, issue these commands

     cd public_html/bpappReleases
     unzip bpappYYYYMMDD
            // Should unzip the files, creating folder bpappYYYYMMDD
     ls bpappYYYYMMDD
            // Should see app/, BrandingPays.php, etc.
D.4) Remove the ZIP file and the __MACOSX folder
	  rm bpappYYYYMMDD.zip
	  rm -rf __MACOSX

----------------------------------------
* STEP E: VERIFY UPLOADED APPLICATION
----------------------------------------
E.1) Open up a browser and go to
     http://brandingpays.com/bpappReleases/bpappYYYYMMDD/BrandingPays.php
E.2) Verify that the application works correctly

----------------------------------------
* STEP F: MAKE NEW SOFTWARE LIVE
----------------------------------------

!!! FOLLOWING STEPS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED !!!
F.1) Using ssh on the InMotion server, issue these commands:
     (assumes your shell is still in public_html/bpappReleases)

     cd ..
            // Should now be in folder public_html/
     ls -l bpapp
            // You should see a line that ends with something like
            //       bpapp -> bpappReleases/bpapp20110130
            // Copy/paste the "bpappYYYYMMDD" part into the next step
     mv bpapp bpapp.old.bpappYYYYMMDD
            // Move old symbolic link
     ln -s bpappReleases/bpappYYYYMMDD bpapp
            // Makes new symbolic link that points to new release
 
F.2) Test the URL 
     http://brandingpays.org/bpapp/BrandingPays.php

F.3) If testing works fine, you are done.
     Otherwise, if you need to restore old symbolic link:

     rm bpapp
     mv bpapp.old.bpappYYYYMMDD bpapp
